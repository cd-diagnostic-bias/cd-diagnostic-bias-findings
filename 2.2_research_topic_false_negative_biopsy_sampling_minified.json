Note: Grok 4.1 flagged that the Karimzadhagh 2025 PMID (40113242) may not yet be indexed as of Feb 2026; the earlier McCarty 2018 estimate of 5% remains the most conservative validated figure. Three-way peer review (Opus 4.6, Opus 4.5, Grok 4.1) showed strong concordance on core metrics with minor differences in USCD prevalence range (reflecting the newer vs older meta-analyses)."}}
