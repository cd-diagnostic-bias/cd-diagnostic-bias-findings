Each reviewer caught errors the other validated — confirming value of parallel independent review.","executive_summary":"The Modified Marsh-Oberhuber classification — widely treated as histological gold standard for celiac disease — was never independently validated, shows only fair interobserver agreement (κ=0.35 overall, κ=0.33 for the critical Marsh 3A boundary), and is demonstrably dependent on serology (Denholm 2024: agreement improves 10% when IgA-tTG2 results are provided). In community practice, 41% of expert-confirmed Marsh 3A is called 'normal,' 34–58% of biopsies are suboptimally oriented, and only 35% of US endoscopies meet ≥4-specimen guidelines. Quantitative morphometry reveals that subjective assessment misses 77–100% of confirmed villous atrophy, and the original classification author rejected the Oberhuber 3a/3b/3c subdivisions based on >3,000 biopsies. Potential celiac disease (seropositive Marsh 0–1) affects 10–20% of seropositive patients with clinically significant morbidity. NCGS shows subtle but measurable mucosal changes (villus height 600 vs 900 μm, elevated FABP2) and 24% of seronegative non-CD patients harbor mucosal anti-tTG2 deposits. For the reference patient (DQ8, Marsh 3A, all serology <1, low IgG1, low secretory IgA), the Marsh classification represents a compounding diagnostic vulnerability: DQ8 is overrepresented in ultra-short CD, Marsh 3A has worst interobserver agreement, seronegative patients lack the serology anchor that improves pathologist accuracy, and standard H&E misses sub-histological damage detectable by γδ T-cell analysis (87% sensitivity in seronegative VA), mucosal tTG-IgA deposits, and quantitative morphometry. Critically, even the 'rescue biomarker' of mucosal tTG-IgA deposits (90% sensitive in standard seronegative CD) may fail in patients with IgG1 subclass deficiency, because compromised sequential class switching (IgM→IgG1→IgA) impairs mucosal IgA production — leaving γδ T-cell assessment and quantitative morphometry as the only reliable serology-independent diagnostic tools for this patient profile.","key_findings":[{"finding_id":"F1","finding":"Interobserver agreement for Marsh-Oberhuber classification is only fair (κ=0.31–0.49), with the diagnostically critical Marsh 3A boundary showing κ=0.33.
