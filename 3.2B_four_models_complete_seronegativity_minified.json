Model A (reduced antigen-specific antibody production): DQ8-restricted epitope repertoire (3-6 vs 14-17 for DQ2.5) compounded by IgG1 deficiency impairing sequential IgM→IgG1→IgA class switching. Model B (wrong antigen): DGP test peptide (PLQPEQPFP) has zero sequence homology with the immunodominant DQ8-α-I epitope. Model C (mucosal sequestration): tissue TG2 traps locally produced antibodies before they reach serum (Salmi 2006: 100% mucosal deposits in seronegative CD). Model D (wrong proxy variable): guidelines use serum total IgA to validate IgA-based serology, but the reference patient has normal serum IgA with fecal secretory IgA below the commercial laboratory's measurement range — proving that serum IgA is not a valid proxy for mucosal IgA production capacity, which is where anti-tTG2 IgA originates. Critically, these four models are NOT independent: IgG1 deficiency is the shared hub connecting A and D (impaired sequential switching reduces both antigen-specific AND total mucosal IgA), while DQ8 genotype is the hub connecting A and B. Three testable markers — IgG1 subclass, fecal secretory IgA, and full HLA-DQ typing — can identify patients at risk for all four failure modes, yet none are in any diagnostic guideline.","key_findings":[{"finding_id":"3.2B-F1","finding":"DQ8 restricts only 3-6 well-characterized gluten T-cell epitopes versus 14-17 for DQ2.5, a 3-5x disparity in antigenic repertoire.

Key quantitative estimates (50-70% reduction per mechanism) are extrapolated from indirect evidence rather than directly measured in DQ8-only cohorts. The pIgR paradox provides internal consistency check favoring Model A over Model C. Model D (serum IgA ≠ mucosal IgA) is directly demonstrated by patient data but population prevalence of this dissociation is unknown. The four models organize around two mechanistic hubs (IgG1 → A+D; DQ8 → A+B) rather than being independent, suggesting a compact diagnostic panel could identify at-risk patients. The most critical limitation is that no single study has simultaneously examined HLA genotype, IgG subclass levels, fecal secretory IgA, and mucosal deposit characteristics in the same seronegative CD cohort."}}
